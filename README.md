**NewsClassifier: Automated News Classification System with NLP Techniques**
This project focuses on building an automated news classification system using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. It involves scraping news articles from various sources, preprocessing the data, training classification models, and deploying an application for news categorization.

**Overview**
The system follows these major steps:

**Web Scraping:**

Utilizes web scraping tools like BeautifulSoup and Selenium to extract news articles from selected websites (e.g., BBC, The Hindu, Times Now, CNN).
Retrieves article titles and content to form a diverse dataset covering multiple topics.
Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:

Removes irrelevant information like HTML tags, advertisements, and non-text content.
Tokenizes text, eliminates stop words, and performs lemmatization or stemming for text normalization.
Handles missing data to ensure consistent formatting.
Text Representation:

Converts text data into numerical format suitable for machine learning models using TF-IDF or word embeddings like Word2Vec and GloVe.
Considers utilizing pre-trained word embeddings for enhanced model performance.
Topic Clustering:

Applies clustering algorithms (e.g., K-means, hierarchical clustering) on preprocessed text data to group similar articles.
Determines the number of clusters based on target topics (e.g., Sports, Business, Politics, Weather).
Topic Labeling:

Manually inspects a sample of articles in each cluster to assign meaningful topic labels for the clusters.
Classification Model:

Splits the data into training and testing sets.
Trains a supervised machine learning model (e.g., Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines, LSTM, or BERT) to predict news article topics using labeled clusters as ground truth.
Evaluation:

Assesses the model's performance on the testing set using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Performs fine-tuning of model parameters if required to improve performance.
